History:

XinBox began as a simple mod of the "XBMC Mail" scritp by burriko. 
This mod was simply adding another button for an extra inbox.
This mod was released under the name XBMC Mail(SSS Mod) in Decebmer '06.
After this, various releases were made adding in "Storing emails" and user settings via the GUI.
The scrit eventually changed names to "Xinbox Inbox" as most of the code was now new and not original code from burriko's script.
After a few more releases, the script came to its final name that it is today.
XinBox also had a few version updates and the latest version 0.3 was released Jan '07.
Stanley87 then took a break from scripting. Moved apartments and began again on this new release of XinBox.
