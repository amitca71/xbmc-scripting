Updated August 27, 2004
- Implemented PIL Image conversion -- im.save(filename, "GIF") method -- to allow 
 	the Emulator scripts to handle multiple image types. (Previously only GIFs 
	were allowed.)

	NOTE: The emulator now REQUIRES that you have PIL installed for it to work 
	properly. If you don't have PIL installed on your PC, you can download it 
	free from this site: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
