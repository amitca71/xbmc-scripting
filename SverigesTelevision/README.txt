 To get the high quality streams you need to update the video core of XBMC.

 1. http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?t=23969
    The mplayer snapshot from 2007-01-17 seems to work well, haven't tried
    earlier or later versions.

 2. Extract the zip file and put mplayer.dll and codecs.conf
    in XBMC/system/players/mplayer on the xbox.

 If you like this script and feel like chipping in a buck or two for
 my future TV licenses, and XBMC script hacks, you can donate using
 the email above over at http://www.paypal.com

 If you are a Swede and have no TV license yourself I strongly suggest
 you use that money to get one on your own pronto!
