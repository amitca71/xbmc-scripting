 Requirements: T3CH XBMC SVN rev10070 is known to work.

 With this script you don't need any antenna to your TV any longer to enjoy
 the contents of Swedish Television. I myself gave up the antenna cable up
 months ago, and soon I've forgotten what it feels like to bang your head
 against crappy shows just because you got stuck in the sofa. This script
 does in fact make you spend your time much more efficient than you used
 to. You can watch the news at any time you wish, get your latest Kobra
 fix or laugh at Kvarteret Skatan seven o'clock in the morning.

 In the dark ages of XBMC you needed to mess around with snapshots of
 mplayer builds to get the good quality clips. Thanks to the workings
 of some leet spare time hackers this is no longer needed and you can
 now just lean back in your sofa and chillax to all the great content
 SVT has to offer.

 If you like this script and feel like chipping in a buck or two, so that
 I can pay my future my future TV licenses, and spend more time on XBMC
 script hacking, you can donate using the email above over at PayPal.

 If you are a Swede and have no TV license yourself I strongly suggest
 you use that money to get one on your own pronto!

 Long Live Free (as in speech) Television!

 Oh, and there is a petition that wants SVT to use free codecs here:
