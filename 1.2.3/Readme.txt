XBMC Lyrics Script by SveinT (sveint@gmail.com)

1. Installation

Should be pretty simple. Copy script to the folder where the script is located.
The script will only show if a song is currently playing. It should automatically update as song changes.

2. Bugs

I am sure there are plenty. Please report them...

3. Support

Thanks a lot to ChokeManiac for his great skins, and his panel2.jpg in specfic which I have used (slightly modified) in this script.
Of course a huge thanks also to the coders and supporters of XBMC - it's a wonderful piece of work :)
Last, thanks to solexalex and TomKun for suggestions and fixes.
