XinBox Version 0.99.7 Change Log:

Fixed: There was Hard-Coded Button Labels in Update Menu
Updated: Mini-Mode function, now when new email is received in mini-mode and user opens it, it will take user to Inbox, 
         and then if user presses back or exit, script closes and mini-mode resumes.
