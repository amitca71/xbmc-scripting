XinBox Version 0.99.93 Change Log:

Fixed: Certain labels in menus would not show fully.
Added: New Mini-Mode menu! White Button when New Email notification pops up.
	This will take you to the new Mini-Mode menu where you can read the new emails without opening the script.
        You can then click "InBox" to go to inbox or press back to close and mini-mode will continue.
Updated: "Mini-Mode Started" and "Mini-Mode Closed" - now hard-coded English due to using other languages cause script
         to fail. Don't think XBMC likes it.
