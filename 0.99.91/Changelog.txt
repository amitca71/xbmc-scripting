XinBox Version 0.99.91 Change Log:

Added: Import button to contacts menu, this can be used to import an address book in .csv file format.
       Check the readme.txt for more details.
Updated: Update Engine - Now checks for missing settings when script starts (this will allow for
	 scripts updated not via internal update to still work)
         Also, made it so you can update to current version - just in case of bad update or something.
Added: New Account Setting - "Auto Check" Enable to make all accounts inboxes auto check for new
       emails when inbox logged into.
Added: "Default" label next to default inbox (if one) in account menu.

Thanks to "realjobe" for the ideas :-D
